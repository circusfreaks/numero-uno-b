					<h2>History</h2>

					<p class="lead-in">Koro-sensei (殺せんせー, Koro-sensē) is the main protagonist and anti-hero of the series.</p>

					<p>He is a powerful octopus-like creature who is the homeroom teacher of Class 3-E of Kunugigaoka Junior High School. Kuro-sensei is initially thought to be the perpetrator of the explosion of the Moon, which has rendered it permanently in a crescent shape; this is later revealed to be false, as the true culprit was a mouse implanted with his cells that had been sent to the moon as part of an experiment. Despite not having the intention to get killed, he offered to governments all over the world a chance to kill him under the condition that he is allowed to be the homeroom teacher of Class 3-E until the end of the year, when he will destroy the Earth by self-explosion unless he is killed. He is dedicated to his task as a teacher and imparting his knowledge of assassination to the students, despite knowing full well that he is their target. However, he is able to connect with each student individually, which is why all of his students respect him, despite knowing that he will destroy the planet in a year. He takes a form similar to an octopus with eight tentacles and his skin color changes depending on his mood. He is able to move at a maximum speed of Mach 20 (15345.383 miles per hour), which allows him to travel across the world in a short amount of time and makes him a hard target to hit. He is also intelligent to the point that he could teach almost every subject to all of his students single-handedly. He does however have a number of weaknesses, mainly to special rubber knives and BB pellets specifically designed to work against his body.</p>

					<p>While he is initially believed to be an alien, he later reveals that he was once a legendary human assassin who was the original Reaper. After being betrayed by his apprentice (the Reaper seen throughout the series), he was captured and sent to a facility where a series of experiments were performed on him and transforms his body which causes him to mutate into a new form. Koro-sensei was born in the slums of an unknown third world country, where he soon learned he had a natural talent for killing and an inborn lack of empathy. He became an assassin, murdering anyone for the right price, even world leaders and the heads of entire militaries. However, after being captured and used as a guinea pig, he begins to learn compassion and empathy from a female intern with whom he becomes close. His decision to become a teacher involves his promise to the intern who thought that he was suitable to become one, later revealed to be Class 3-E's former teacher, Aguri Yukimura, who was selected to be his observer during the experiments performed on him. According to Koro-sensei, his lifespan will be over by the end of the school year in March, and if he is not killed by then, the whole planet will perish with him due to the explosive release of the anti-matter in his body that was generated by the experiments performed on him. After a vicious clash with Kōtarō Yanagisawa, the scientist responsible for his current condition, and his former apprentice, the second 'God of Death', and using all of his energy left to save one of his students who was mortally injured during the confrontation, an exhausted Koro-sensei bids farewell to his students and finally allows them to kill him, with Nagisa ultimately doing so by stabbing him in the heart. After being assassinated, his body disintegrates into multiple floating orbs of light while his clothes are left behind.</p>

					<p>Koro-sensei's name is a pun on the words korosenai (殺せない, lit. unkillable) and sensei (先生, lit. teacher).</p>

					<h2>Powers</h2>

					<div class="power-list">

						<div class="power-item power-item--one">
							<h3>Antimatter Physiology</h3>
							<p>Due to the human experiments of producing antimatter in a living body by Shiro, Korosensei's entire appearance is that of an octopus-like creature with multiple tendrils that function as his tentacles. Anything aside from Anti-Sensei Weapons will be ineffective in harming him. It is initially believed that he would self-destruct by the time of Class E's graduation; however, it has since been proven that the chances are minuscule at best.</p>
						</div>

						<div class="power-item power-item--two">
							<h3>Superhuman Speed</h3>
							<p>Korosensei can travel up to the speed of Mach 20. His normally soft and jelly-like head hardens under immense pressure as a process known as the dilatancy phenomenon, which presumably lowers his wind resistance, allowing him to reach inhuman speeds. The only known objects to surpass this are the reusable space shuttle and the transformed Reaper.o</p>
						</div>

						<div class="power-item power-item--three">
							<h3>Superhuman Senses</h3>
							<p>Korosensei's sensory perceptions are paramount, and can detect even the most minuscule of changes in temperature, light, sound, and smell. Despite having no visible ears or nose, Korosensei has proven to be able to hear things no normal human can pick up on, as well as detect the most minor of aromas, which aided him greatly in evading the assassination attempts of Class 3-E. </p>
						</div>

						<div class="power-item power-item--four">
							<h3>Liquefaction</h3>
							<p>After he drank the 4th poison made by Manami Okuda, Korosensei developed an ability to control his fluidity. He can morph into a mass of mercury-like slime. In cost of his massive body and tentacles, Korosensei can fit through any space while retaining most of his abilities.
